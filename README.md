# Website Performance Optimization Portfolio Project

The objective of this project was to test the studentâ€™s ability to improve an extremely inefficient website. Supporting courses included Website Performance Optimization and Browser Rendering Optimization. 

#Requirements

Achieving a Google PageSpeed of 90 or above and a FPS of 60 for pizza-min.html

#Access Website

To access the website, copy and paste the following url into your browsers address bar:

#How optimizations were made

##Index.html Page Display

* CSS was inlined to remove render blocking.
* All css was minifyied to reduce bytes for faster parsing.
* JS files for index.html were given the async attribute to remove render blocking.
* images were reduced to thumbmail size and compressed to reduce file size.
* Google fonts was removed to remove render blocking and downloading. Affect on text was marginal
* CSS element tags were replaced with faster element or class tags. 
* css/style-print.css was given the media tag `print` to remove render blocking.
* Comments removed.

##pizza.html Page Display (browser runs pizza-min.html)

* Reduced and compressed images.
* Provided more specific tags for faster rendering.
* Inlined CSS to remove render blocking.
* Minified bootstrap-grid.css to bootstrap-grid-min.css.
* added `will-change: transform` and `translateZ(0);` to force seperate layers for classes mover and randomPizzaContainer.
* Replaced for while loop for for makeRandomPizza with while (var --) for faster rendering.
* Replaced all `document.querySelector` methods with more specific methods such as `document.getElementsByClassName`.
* Simplified `changePizzaSizes(size)` function.
* Reduced Forced Synchronous Layout be declaring variables outside of for loops. See example here [https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud860-nd/l-4147498575/e-4154208580/m-4240308553]
* Reduced number of randomly generated pizzas that appeared on screen as well as pizzas in the background.
